These variables have the following definitions:

COOP ID   	is the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network station identification 
		code. Note that the first two digits in the Coop ID 
		correspond to the assigned state number (see table below).
  	  	 
LATITUDE	is latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).
  	  	 
LONGITUDE   	is the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).
  	  	 
ELEVATION   	is the elevation of the station (in meters, missing = -999.9).
  	  	 
STATE 	  	is the U.S. postal code for the state.
  	  	 
NAME 	  	is the name of the station location.
  	  	 
COMPONENT 1   	is the Coop Id for the first station (in chronologic order) 
                whose records were joined with those of the HCN site to 
		form a longer time series. "------" indicates "not applicable".
  	  	 
COMPONENT 2   	is the Coop Id for the second station (if applicable) whose records were 
		joined with those of the HCN site to form a longer time series.
  	  	 
COMPONENT 3   	is the Coop Id for the third station (if applicable) whose records were 
		joined with those of the HCN site to form a longer time series.
  	  	 
UTC OFFSET   	is the time difference between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and 
		local standard time at the station (i.e., the number of hours 
		that must be added to local standard time to match UTC).
